####What is Ember.js?  
Ember.js is an open-source JavaScript web framework, based on the model–view–controller (MVC) pattern. It allows developers to create scalable single-page web applications by incorporating common idioms and best practices into the framework.  Its Rails for Javascript!

####Ember.js vs Angular
#####Angular
* Easier to learn - explain
* Doesn't use terminology like MVC - instead Scopes, directives and transclusion.

#####Ember.js
* Nearly as opinionated as Rails
* Easier to set up structures within its confines because of its fixed notions on how things work out.
* Uses two-way bindings for registering HTML updates - Handlebars!  {{
* Simpler to understand, as it assumes you already know what MVC is

Ember has "Handlebar" while Angular has "Dirty Checking"

Has a built in concatenator - this means that you wouldn't need to use Gulp. 

Angular tracks the previous values for these various expressions. If it notices a change, the corresponding Angular directive is given a chance to reflect those changes in the DOM. So if employee.fullname() changes, the interpolation directive (the fancy name for the double curly-braces syntactic sugar) has a chance to reflect this change in the DOM.
